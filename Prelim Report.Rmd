## Introduction

## Background

The topic of interest is that of New York vehicle collisions. When studying this data set, it is important to understand key terminology and definitions that may not be entirely intuitive. This data set refers to 'vehicle collisions', which @DataGovNY refers to as "collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least \$1000 worth of damage". This means this data set is not completely representative of all collisions, as small crashes in which there was little damage, or the dispute was handled without police intervention, i.e. cash payouts, are not included within the data.

Additionally, vehicles are defined as any transportation method involved in the collision, meaning that vehicles such as bikes, tractors, E-scooters, snow plows and other unusual entries are included, as well as the usual vehicles.

Finally, the data set refers to Boroughs, which is an administrative district of a larger encompassing area. In New York specifically, the five Boroughs are Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx and Staten Island.

## Research Question

In this report, analysis will be performed in order to investigate the dynamics of New York Boroughs regarding motor vehicle collisions. This will be broken down into several questions.

-   Which New York Borough is the most "dangerous"?
-   How have the dynamics of vehicle collisions changed over time?

Additionally, we will examine if this data set, and the transformations on the data, are useful and/or practical for answering these questions.

## Rationale

The need for this study comes from the interest in vehicle collision dynamics throughout varying environments. It is widely known that crash dynamics vary greatly from urban to rural areas, in the sense that rural areas tend to have less crashes, while having proportionally more fatal crashes, and urban areas having many more minor crashes. These are the dynamics of two extremely different environments, with clear cause and effects. The interest in the opportunity this data analysis provides arises from the diversity of New York's environment. Each Borough is clearly distinct from each other, and inferences about their crash dynamics may be constructed by geographical location, population density etc. The data analysis aims to verify these inferences, and create an understanding of crash dynamics that for most may be only surface level.

## Data Descriptions

The data set is a free, public use set found from the US Government's open data base. The data frame has over 2 million observations, ranging from July 2012 to March 2025. Each observation has 29 variables, including dates, locations, casualties, vehicle codes for up to 5 vehicles and contributing factors for up to 5 vehicles.

This data set, due to its exhaustive coverage, has many issues and limitations, as well as inconsistencies. For example, Vision Zero, an initiative for traffic safety was started in 2014, and had a fairly slow roll-out. This initiative emphasized succinct data collection. Before the took full effect, vehicle type codes were observed using the standard DMV codes, which slowly transitioned into a more detailed collection of data. The prime example of this is the "passenger vehicle" class in this data set, which was in later observations divided further into classes such as sedans, coupes and station wagons.

The data is further limited by the data collection, which is largely inconsistent. Many observations have blank details in multiple variables, with the only consistently filled variable being date. Due to the data being compiled largely from 3rd party sources, it is understandable that the data collection is inconsistent.

For the analysis, the prime variables that will be observed are Borough, vehicle type code, date and injuries. The analysis of these variables will allow for a deep understanding of the severity, location, and details of the collisions, without complicating the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In order to provide suitable analysis, some exhaustive data wrangling must be performed. The first step in analysis will be filtering the data heavily:

1.  Creating a new data frame, which has been filtered to remove observations that have blank entries in vehicle type codes.
2.  Selecting 9 key variables, to remove unnecessary cluttering in the data frame.
3.  Mutating to create a new variable, number of vehicles, which displays how many vehicles are involved in a collision
4.  Further filtering on the frame to remove observations with blank spaces in Borough entries, as well as fixing the date variable so that it is recognised by R as a date.

Further, the data frame contains thousands of unique observations for vehicle type code, so making a frame that only includes the top 20 and top 5 vehicle most frequent vehicle types would aid in analysis. To do this courtesy of @StatGlobe, a sorted table of the vehicle types must be made, which is then made into a tibble, as the slice function can not be done on tables. Once the tibble is sliced for the top 50 entries, unique identical entries (Taxi and TAXI for example) are combined, and new frames including the combined top 20 and top 5 vehicles are made.

From this, plots can be made with ggplot. The first planned plot is a point plot showing the relationship between number of vehicles and number of people injured, faceted by Borough, and coloured by vehicle code.

The second plot is a ridgeplot, showing crash density throughout time, by vehicle type.

These two plots in particular will be vital in answering the research questions, along with relevant summary statistics when required.
